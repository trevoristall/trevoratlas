Since starting my new job at Knucklepuck Media in December, we’ve had a weekly book club where we discuss what we’re reading and anything that’s come up recently related to it. Dale Carnegie’s “How to Win Friends & Influence People” is what we’re working on now.

I really like this book, a lot of what’s discussed seems obvious but it’s really nice to have someone remind you once in a while. The fact that this is still a bestselling book is testament to just how relevant the content is.

The premise is simple: be kind to others, listen to what’s said and carefully consider their point of view. Admit your own faults quickly and ask questions instead of commanding. Lead by example with encouragement and  praise.

On a personal level, I regularly fail to do many of these things. Being reminded by such a thoughtful and well written book is not only good for day-to-day life but also helps set a precedent for myself going forward.
